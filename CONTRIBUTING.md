## Info About This Wiki

### Angle Brackets
Throughout this guide, code blocks like `<Value>` are used. This means that "Value" should be replaced by something, and the "<>" should be deleted.

### Citra Version
All data must be collected from the latest official Citra nightly, downloaded from [here](https://citra-emu.org/download/).

### Dates
All dates follow the format `<4-Digit Year>-<2-Digit Month>-<2-Digit Day>`. For example, June 3rd 2017 would be "2017-06-03".

### GitHub Issues
Game issues can be found [here](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/issues). The ID of the issue can be found at the end of the URL. For example, [SNES Virtual Console Games - Crash on Boot](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/issues/2782)'s ID is 2782.

### Screenshots
The recommended application for capturing the icon, boxart, and screenshots is [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX). Screenshots can not be compressed, and must be in the PNG format.

### Title IDs
The title ID for a game is a unique ID representing that release of the game. Often, games released in multiple regions will have a different title ID for each, with the exception of some games like the main series Pokémon games. A database of such releases and their title IDs can be found [here](http://3dsdb.com/).

To find the title ID of your release, it can be found near the top of a log when running a game. For example, this is what it looks like for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, `0004000000033500`: `[   0.019882] Loader <Info> core/loader/ncch.cpp:Load:340: Program ID: 0004000000033500`.

### TOML
In this repo, DAT files follow the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax, where each line consists of the creation of a piece of data. The simplest form of this is assigning a value to a key (`<Key> = <Value>`). The data types used for these `Value`s in this wiki are:
 - Booleans, true or false (Example: `true`.)
 - Integers, numbers (Example: `5`.)
 - Strings, characters with surrounding quotes (Example: `"Hi!"`.)
 - Arrays, collection of booleans, integers, or strings (Example for an array of integers: `[33, 2398, 234]`.)

These key/value pairs can be grouped together using an array of tables (Example: `[[ Stuff ]]`, with the pairs on the next lines.). These can be used more than once in a TOML file.

## Code
The code consists of the actual files in the Github repisitory. To modify them, you have to fork this repo, make your changes, and send a pull request.

At the root, there's a folder for each game. The names of these folders should follow these specifications:
- Only use letters, numbers, and hyphens (No spaces!), because they will be linked to on the site.
- Names should be lowercase to ensure consistency.
- Have a wiki page with the same name.

### Metadata
The metadata for the game is located at `/<Game Name>/game.dat`. This is required info about the game, all feilds are mandatory unless noted otherwise. The DAT values (See: [TOML](#toml)) are:
- `title` (String): English title of the game. This doesn't have to match the wiki or folder name, so there can be spaces.
- `description` (String): Get these from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_3DS_games). Short, 2-3 line description of the game.
- `github_issues` (Array of integers): The GitHub issue IDs for the game. See: [GitHub Issues](#github-issues).
- `needs_system_files` (Boolean): Whether the game requests the system files or not, regardless of whether it could be played without them (See: [Citra Version](#citra-version)).
- `needs_shared_font` (Boolean): Whether the game requests the shared font or not, regardless of whether it could be played without them (See: [Citra Version](#citra-version)).
- `game_type` (String): Whether the game has a retail release, `"3ds"`, is an E-Shop **exclusive**, `"eshop"`, a Virtual Console game, `"vc"`, or DSiWare, `"dsi"`. This line is optional for retail releases.
- `releases` (Array of tables): Info about each release of the game. **The USA release should come first.**
  - `title` (String): Title ID of this release of the game. See: [Title IDs](#title-ids).
  - `region` (String): Region of the game. Possible values are:
    - `aus`
    - `chn`
    - `eur`
    - `jpn`
    - `kor`
    - `twn`
    - `usa`
    - `all` (Don't tag a game released in multiple regions as `all`. This is reserved for specific games released as such.)
  - `release_date` (String): When the game was released in this region. See: [Dates](#dates).

An example of a game metadata file is the one for [The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/game.dat):
```toml
title = "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D"
description = "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D is an action-adventure video game co-developed by Grezzo and Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console. The game is an enhanced remake of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, which was originally released for the Nintendo 64 home console in 2000. The game was released worldwide in February 2015"
github_issues = [2517]
needs_system_files = false
needs_shared_font = false

[[ releases ]]
title = "0004000000125500"
region = "usa"
release_date = "2015-02-13"

[[ releases ]]
title = "0004000000125600"
region = "eur"
release_date = "2015-02-13"
```

### Icon
The icon for a game is located at `/<Game Name>/icon.png` (See: [Screenshots](#screenshots). The suggested process for getting one is:
- Make sure the ROM for the game is in your Citra game directory.
- Take a screenshot of Citra's library listing (See: [Citra Version](#citra-version)).
- Crop out the game icon.
- The icon should be `48x48`.

### Boxart
The boxart for the game is located at `/<Game Name>/boxart.png`. The suggested process for getting retail boxart is:
- Download a scan from [GameTDB](http://www.gametdb.com/), preferably with the `Nintendo 3DS` logo on the right.
- The boxart should be from the USA.
- Downsize it to `328x300` using [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/).
- Compress it using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

The required process for getting eShop only boxart is:
- Run the game in Citra (See: [Citra Version](#citra-version)).
- Use 1x internal resolution.
- Increase the window size of Citra to fill most of your monitor.
- Screenshot the title screen, which should only be the top screen.
- Downsize it to `500x300` using [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/).
- Compress it using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
- Examples are [Fairune](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/fairune/boxart.png) and [Pokémon Picross](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/pokemon-picross/boxart.png)

The required process for getting virtual console boxart is:
- Run the game in Citra (See: [Citra Version](#citra-version)).
- Use 1x internal resolution.
- Increase the window size of Citra to fill most of your monitor.
- Screenshot the title screen, which should only be the top screen.
- Downsize it to `328x300` using [PicResize](http://www.picresize.com/).
- Compress it using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).
- Examples are [Legend of Zelda](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/legend-of-zelda/boxart.png) and [Tetris](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/blob/master/games/tetris/boxart.png)

### Game Screenshots
The screenshots for the game are located in `/<Game Name>/screenshots/` (See: [Screenshots](#screenshots)). Screenshots **must** follow these specifications:
  - Native resolution.
  - Smallest window size.
  - Have variety. In addition to, say, the title screen, you should also have screenshots of different areas of gameplay, unless the game crashes before then.
  - Accurate file name. The file name should provide a general idea of what's being shown (e.g. `title-screen.png`, `lost-woods.png`, `level-3-4.png`).
  - Black background (For the blank space left and right of the bottom screen.). This is the default setting, but if you've changed it, go to the [User Directory](https://citra-emu.org/wiki/user-directory/), and from there navigate to the `config` directory. Open qt-config.ini with a text editor, and set bg_blue, bg_green, and bg_red to 0.

Additionally, if a game has a rating of 3 or higher, **you must include at least 3 screenshots**, otherwise 1 screenshot is acceptable.

### Savefiles
#### Save Metadata
The metadata for a save is located at `/<Game Name>/savefiles/<Save Name>.dat`. This is info about the save. The DAT values (See: [TOML](#toml)) are:
- `title` (String): The location of the save ingame.
- `description` (String): A brief explanation about the save.
- `author` (String): Your forum account name, if you have one. If you don't, don't include this line.
- `title_id` (String): Title ID of the game. See: [Title IDs](#title-ids).

#### Save Data
The save data is located at `/<Game Name>/savefiles/<Save Name>.zip` (See: [Citra Version](#citra-version)). To make a ZIP file, the process is:
- Make sure the ROM for the game is in your Citra game directory.
- Right click on the game and click `Open Save Data Location`. This should open a folder named `data`.
- Note the folder that the `data` folder is in. This is the low Title ID. As an example, the low Title ID for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is `00033500`.
- The folder that the low Title ID folder is in should be named `00040000`, the high Title ID.
- Copy the high title ID folder elsewhere.
- Delete everything from the high title ID folder except for the low Title ID folder.
- Compress the high title ID folder into a ZIP.

## Wiki
The wiki contains info about specific game problems, and can be modified by anyone. They use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formatting.

Each page's title should match the game's respective folder in the code section, except with hyphens in the code changed to spaces on the wiki. **Don't use the following characters in your wiki page's titles: \ / : * ? " < > |.**

The format of each page is as follows:
- H2 header with text saying `Summary`.
- Brief summary of how the game performs: graphically, auditorily, and frame rate (with general hardware comparison - see MK7 example). This should be written objectively, without the use of words like "I". See: [Citra Version](#citra-version).

An example of a game wiki page is the one for [Mario Kart 7](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-games-wiki/wiki/Mario-Kart-7):
```markdown
## Summary
Mario Kart 7 has some problems in Citra. Graphically, the game suffers from minor issues,
but requires decent hardware to obtain near full speed. It suffers from minor audio issues at times,
but this does not hinder gameplay in any way. You may experience crashes on some tracks, slow down,
and may need to transfer save files from Citra to your 3DS to complete certain tracks.
```
