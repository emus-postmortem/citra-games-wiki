description = "2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game developed and published by Cosmigo. It was originally designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, you can keep playing the game, creating tiles with larger numbers. 2048 was originally written in JavaScript and CSS during a weekend, and released as free and open-source software subject to the MIT license."
